<p>A teddy bear is a stuffed toy in the form of a bear. ... 
    Since the creation of the first teddy bears which sought
     to imitate the form of real bear cubs, "teddies" have
      greatly varied in form, style, color, and material. 
      They have become collector's items, with older and
       rarer "teddies" appearing at public auctions.</p>

<p>Pigeons are gentle, plump, small-billed birds with a
 skin saddle (cere) between the bill and forehead. 
 All pigeons strut about with a characteristic
  bobbing of the head. Because of their long 
  wings and powerful flight muscles, they are
   strong, swift fliers.</p>

<p>A chameleon is a very unique lizard that
     belongs to the Chamaeleonidae family.
      They inhabit warm locations such as 
      rainforests and deserts. They are known
       to change colors, rapidly shoot their 
       long tongues outward, and move their eyes independently.</p>
<a href=http://origami.me/camel/><img src="Capture5.PNG" width="250px" height="210px"></a>
<p>Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped 
    snout and a humped back. There are two types of
     camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump,
      and Bactrian camels, which have two humps.
       Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which
        they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.</p>
